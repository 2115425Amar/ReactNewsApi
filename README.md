# React News Portal

## Overview
I have developed a responsive React application  News Portal using React Bootstrap for the UI and Fetch API  for fetching news articles from a public API. The application allows users to filter articles by categories and includes pagination for efficient navigation through articles.

## Features Implemented

- **Dynamic Updates**: The article list updates dynamically based on the selected category.

### Pagination
- **Pagination Controls**: Pagination controls are implemented at the bottom of the homepage, allowing users to navigate through different pages of articles.

### Detailed Article View Page

### State Management
